## Definition of the mainboard 
The mainboard/the motherboard, is the `primary circuit board of a computer or other complex systems`. It is the central hub for communication between all other 
hardware components such as processor, memory, and peripherals. It also houses the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), the computerâ€™s software to start up and operate. 
Each mainboard comes outfitted with specific sockets and ports connecting these components.

## Types of mainboards
There are a lot of types of mainboards but the most common type of mainboard used nowdays is the `ATX` and his variants like the Mini-ATX and the Micro-ATX.

## Parts on the mainboard
* **Chipset**
 Is a set of electronic components on one or more integrated circuits that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals.

<img src="img/chipset.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **North bridge and South bridge:**
The northbridge handles the high-speed communication between the CPU, memory, and graphics card, while the southbridge manages the slower 
input/output (I/O) operations and connects devices like hard drives (HD), universal serial bus (USB) devices, and audio interfaces.

<img src="img/SN.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **Ram slots:**
RAM slots or sockets on a PC motherboard are long channels, generally located close to the CPU. There are clasps on each end of the socket, 
which will snap tight around the edge of the RAM when plugged in. RAM slots are often found in pairs and are sometimes color-coded for identification. 
We should note that RAM slots in a desktop look different than RAM slots in a laptop.

<img src="img/ramslot.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **CPU socket:**
A CPU socket uses a series of pins to connect a CPUâ€™s processor to the PCâ€™s motherboard. If a CPU is connected via a CPU socket, 
it is not soldered and can therefore be replaced.

<img src="img/cpusocket.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **BIOS chip**
Is a fundamental component of computers, embedded in the motherboard to perform critical booting operations.

<img src="img/bios.jpg" width="200" height="200">

* **AGP slots**
Is a high-speed interface used in computers to connect graphics cards to the motherboard. AGP provided faster data transfer rates than traditional peripheral component interconnect (PCI) slots, allowing for better graphics performance and more realistic visuals in gaming and other graphical applications.

<img src="img/agp.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **PCI slots**
Is a type of slot that allows you to add additional cards to your computer system. These slots are typically used to add sound cards, network cards, or other types of interface cards.

<img src="img/pci.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **CNR slots**
Is a slot found on certain personal computer motherboards and used for specialized networking, audio, or telephony equipment.

<img src="img/cnr.jpeg" width="200" height="200">

* **SATA slots**
Is a computer interface standard that allows for the transfer of data between storage devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives, and a computer's motherboard.

<img src="img/sata.jpg" width="200" height="200">

* **FCD**
Is responsible for reading data presented from the host computer and converting it to the drive's on-disk format using one of a number of encoding schemes.


* **CMOS Battery**
Is a small, coin-shaped battery found on a computer's motherboard. It provides power to the CMOS chip, which stores important system information such as the date, time, and hardware settings in the CMOS memory.
